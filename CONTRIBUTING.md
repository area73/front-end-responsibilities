# How to contribute

Pull requests are welcome for corrections, typos and clarifications. Please create an issue if you aren't sure what change is needed.

## Additions

If you would like to add responsibilities, please consider whether the responsibility:

* would be generally accepted as part of a front-end engineering capability
* is really a responsibility, and not actually a task, activity or technology. 'React' is not a responsibility. 'Adopt appropriate JavaScript framework' is.
* is an organisational responsibility and not just an individual one.

Please provide a short explanation of why you would like to include the responsibility with your pull request.

## Deletions and restructuring

Pull requests with wholesale restructuring and deletion are unlikely to be considered for approval without a good case. Try creating an issue instead that can be used for discussion purposes in the first instance.

## Code of conduct

Please adhere to the project [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
