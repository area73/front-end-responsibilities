# Front-end engineering responsibilities laundry list

The list below aims to address the following question:

> What are all the organisational responsibilities addressed by front-end engineering roles?

i.e. What could an organisation be addressing in some way? This can be through individual or team contributions. And the responsibilities are not necessarily taken on by identified 'front-end developers'.

You might use the list answer questions like:

* Q: How are we doing [X]?
* Q: Do we need to be thinking about [X]?
* Q: Who should be accountable for [X]? Who should be responsible for it?
* Q: What do front-end developers do at [_ACME Inc_]?

## Important notes

1. This is a laundry list, not a ready made job description or list of individual responsibilities. No one person can do all of this well. Use it as a prompt, not a template.
2. This is largely my own work, so is subject to my particular view of the world, along with its inevitable biases.
